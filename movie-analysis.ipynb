    "## 🚩Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. They have hired us to help them better understand the movie industry. Our team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think this is an exciting venture and the prolific amount of data that is available regarding movie production, reception and sales will be helpful in making data-driven decisions. There are a few questions we'd like to answer as we explore the data that is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "*One important thing as we approach this opportunity is defining what success is. In terms of popularity - there are two overarching metrics that are useful - money and reviews. These are broad and within these categories there are several nuances that influence our perspective on popularity. We will explore various aspects of this in each of the questions below.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q1: What month(s) is best to release a movie?\n",
    "- **Why:** It is in Microsoft's best interest to not wait long to enter the market. However timing is key and making a movie requires careful planning and budgeting of resources and time. To that end, it's important to know when we want to take our end product to market so we can plan backwards. We believe that the particular time a movie is released has an impact on it's popularity.  \n",
    "- **Success Metric:** For this question we will consider gross worldwide revenue. We're interested in finding out what month people are most willing to spend their money on watching a movie and so this is irrespective of the budget or net profit.  \n",
    "- **Watch Out For:** Gross revenue builds over time and *may* not directly corelate to the timing of release. However our inclination is that initial short-term popularity will provide the momentum for certain movies to stand out in terms of ticket sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q2: What genre(s) is the most popular in terms of voting engagement?\n",
    "- **Why:** There are many different directions Microsoft could go when it comes to the content of this initial movie venture. Genre popularity provides a general understanding of what people like to watch. This understanding will help in deciding what direction to movie in terms of content that will help build the brand of Microsoft's movie venture.  \n",
    "- **Success Metric:** We will consider the genre makeup of movies that garner the highest number of votes. Our thinking is that if more people are taking the time to cast a vote for a movie, it is gaining traction with viewers. We'd like to see what genres people are more likely to respond to. Our goal with this business question is getting peopel talking about Microsoft's new movie venture! This will be \n",
    "- **Watch Out For:** There are several assumptions here. It's possible that people may be voting negatively as opposed to positively. However, there's no such thing as bad press so let's discover what genres people respond to, whether good or bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q3: \n",
    "- **Why:**\n",
    "- **Success Metric:**\n",
    "- **Watch Out For:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main pain points we forsee are two-fold. Firstly - it is a saturated market that Microsoft may be be 'jumping on the bandwagon' a bit late in the game. However, we can use the historical market data to our advantage. Secondly, the year 2020 has created a major disruption in the established methodologies of creating and consuming entertainment content, particularly movies. This may prove to be, in fact, the best time for Microsoft to enter the competition!\n",

We are interested in the worldwide_gross as this can be an indicator of overall popularity, regardless of how much was spent in making the movie. We would like to see in what month (or months) the most movies in the top 25% grossing movies were released. We also want to look and see if there is a correlation with the release month of the bottom 25% of movies.\n",
